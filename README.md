# CuisineSense: Inferring Chinese Cuisine Intake from Wearable IMUs

**CuisineSense** is a two-stage multimodal system designed to detect eating states and classify fine-grained Chinese food types 
using wearable Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs). By integrating hand motion cues from a smartwatch and head dynamics from smart
glasses, CuisineSense bridges the gap in wearable dietary monitoring by addressing the challenge of distinguishing the vast
diversity of Chinese cuisine.
